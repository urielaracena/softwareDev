            <h4 id="list-item-1">Sushi</h4>
            <img class="img-thumbnail uniform-thumb" src="images/sushi.jpg" alt="Sushi plate with various nigiri and rolls">
            <p>A dish of vinegared rice combined with fresh raw fish, seafood, or vegetables. The rice is seasoned with rice vinegar, sugar, and salt, then topped or filled with ingredients like tuna, salmon, yellowtail, shrimp, or cucumber. Sushi has a delicate balance of flavors - slightly tart rice complementing the fresh fish, enhanced by small amounts of wasabi (spicy green paste), soy sauce, and pickled ginger. Common types include nigiri (hand-pressed rice topped with fish), maki (rice and fillings rolled in seaweed), and sashimi (just the raw fish, technically not sushi).</p>
            
            <h4 id="list-item-2">Ramen</h4>
            <img class="img-thumbnail uniform-thumb" style="height: 200px; object-fit: cover;" src="images/ramen.jpg" alt="Bowl of ramen with broth, noodles and toppings">
            <p>A noodle soup dish featuring wheat noodles served in a meat-based broth, flavored with soy sauce or miso, and topped with ingredients like sliced pork (chashu), dried seaweed (nori), green onions, and soft-boiled eggs. The broth varieties include shoyu (soy sauce), miso (fermented soybean paste), shio (salt), and tonkotsu (pork bone). Tonkotsu broth is simmered for hours, resulting in a rich, creamy texture. The noodles range from thin and straight to thick and wavy. Ramen offers a complex, umami-rich taste with savory broth, chewy noodles, and tender toppings creating a satisfying meal experience.</p>
            
            <h4 id="list-item-3">Unagi</h4>
            <img class="img-thumbnail uniform-thumb" src="images/unagi.jpg" alt="Grilled unagi eel on rice">
            <p>A traditional delicacy of freshwater eel grilled with a sweet soy-based sauce and typically served over rice. The eel is first split down the back, gutted, boned, and filleted before being skewered and grilled. During cooking, it's repeatedly brushed with tare sauce (a thick, sweet glaze made from soy sauce, mirin, sake, and sugar) in a technique called "kabayaki." This results in a caramelized exterior with a rich, smoky-sweet flavor. The meat has a distinctive tender texture that's fatty and moist. When served as unaju or unadon, it comes on a bed of steamed rice in a lacquered box or bowl, often garnished with sansho pepper, which adds a citrusy, numbing quality that cuts through the richness. Unagi has been prized in Japan for centuries both for its flavor and its supposed stamina-enhancing properties, traditionally eaten during hot summer months.</p>
            
            <h4 id="list-item-4">Yakitori</h4>
            <img class="img-thumbnail uniform-thumb" src="images/yakitori.jpg" alt="Grilled yakitori chicken skewers">
            <p>Skewered chicken pieces grilled over charcoal. Different parts of the chicken are used including breast, thigh, skin, liver, heart, and cartilage, each offering distinct textures and flavors. The meat is cut into bite-sized pieces, skewered on bamboo sticks, and grilled over binchotan (white charcoal). Yakitori is typically seasoned either with tare (a sweet-savory glaze made from soy sauce, mirin, sake, and sugar) or simply with salt (shio). The result is juicy, tender chicken with a smoky char and caramelized exterior. The tare-seasoned varieties have a rich, umami sweetness while salt-seasoned ones highlight the natural chicken flavor.</p>
            
            <h4 id="list-item-5">Okonomiyaki</h4>
            <img class="img-thumbnail uniform-thumb" src="images/okonomiyaki.jpg" alt="Okonomiyaki pancake topped with sauce and bonito flakes">
            <p>A savory pancake containing a variety of ingredients in a wheat-flour-based batter. The batter includes grated nagaimo (mountain yam), dashi, eggs, and shredded cabbage, mixed with ingredients like thinly sliced pork belly, octopus, squid, shrimp, or cheese. In Osaka style, all ingredients are mixed together before cooking, while Hiroshima style layers the ingredients with fried noodles. The batter is poured onto a hot griddle and cooked on both sides until golden brown. Okonomiyaki is topped with a sweet-savory sauce similar to Worcestershire sauce, Japanese mayonnaise, dried seaweed flakes, and dancing bonito flakes (dried fish flakes). It has a savory, umami taste with a fluffy interior and slightly crisp exterior.</p>
            
            <h4 id="list-item-6">Katsu Curry</h4>
            <img class="img-thumbnail uniform-thumb" src="images/katsu-curry.jpg" alt="Katsu curry with rice and breaded cutlet">
            <p>A dish combining crispy breaded cutlet with Japanese curry sauce, served over rice. The katsu is typically a pork cutlet (tonkatsu) or chicken breast, pounded thin, seasoned with salt and pepper, coated in flour, beaten egg, and panko breadcrumbs, then deep-fried until golden and crunchy. The curry sauce contains onions, carrots, potatoes, and sometimes apples, cooked with curry powder or roux blocks (containing curry powder, flour, and fat), then simmered until thick. Japanese curry is milder and sweeter than Indian curries, with a thick, gravy-like consistency. The dish offers contrasting textures of crunchy cutlet, smooth curry, and fluffy rice, with a flavor profile that's savory, slightly sweet with subtle spices rather than heat.</p>

            <h4 id="list2-item-1">Japanese Maple</h4>
            <img class="img-thumbnail uniform-thumb" src="images/japanese-maple.jpg" alt="Japanese maple with vibrant red foliage">
            <p>Japanese maple (Acer palmatum) is renowned for its spectacular foliage displays. The tree features delicate, palmate leaves with 5-9 pointed lobes that emerge in spring with vibrant colors ranging from bright chartreuse to deep burgundy. Throughout summer, the leaves maintain rich colors before transforming into fiery shades of scarlet, orange, and gold in autumn. Hundreds of cultivars offer variations in leaf shape, size, and color—from the feathery, dissected leaves of 'Crimson Queen' to the star-shaped leaves of 'Sango-kaku' that transition from green to brilliant coral-red. These small trees typically grow 15-25 feet tall in graceful, spreading forms with elegant branching patterns visible in winter after leaves drop. The delicate leaf structure creates dappled shade and a sense of airy lightness in garden settings.</p>
            
            <h4 id="list2-item-2">Sakura (Cherry Blossom)</h4>
            <img class="img-thumbnail uniform-thumb" style="height: 200px; object-fit: cover;" src="images/japanese-sakura.jpg" alt="Cherry blossom tree in full bloom">
            <p>Sakura trees (Prunus species) produce Japan's most iconic flower display during their brief spring blooming period. The delicate five-petaled blossoms range from pure white to various shades of pink, often starting darker in bud form before lightening as they open. Blooms appear in dramatic profusion along branches before leaves emerge, creating clouds of color. Popular varieties include Somei Yoshino (pale pink single flowers), Shirotae (white double flowers), and Kwanzan (deep pink double blossoms). The flowers last just 1-2 weeks before floating to the ground in ethereal petal showers called sakura fubuki (cherry blossom snowfall). Beyond their spring display, cherry trees offer attractive reddish-brown bark with horizontal lenticels, and some varieties produce small ornamental fruits. Their fleeting beauty embodies the Japanese aesthetic principle of mono no aware—the poignant awareness of impermanence.</p>
            
            <h4 id="list2-item-3">Japanese Peony</h4>
            <img class="img-thumbnail uniform-thumb" src="images/japanese-peony.jpg" alt="Lush Japanese tree peony blooms">
            <p>Japanese tree peonies (Paeonia suffruticosa) produce some of the most spectacular flowers in the garden world. Unlike herbaceous peonies, these woody shrubs maintain their structure year-round, growing 3-7 feet tall. The flowers are truly magnificent—dinner-plate sized blooms measuring 8-12 inches across with silky, ruffled petals in colors ranging from pure white to yellow, coral, deep magenta, and nearly black purple. Many varieties feature dramatic central boss of yellow stamens or striking color blends with picotee edges or flares. The flowers appear in late spring and have a subtle, sweet fragrance. Even when not in bloom, tree peonies offer garden interest with their deeply lobed, blue-green leaves that turn bronze-purple in fall. These plants were cultivated in Japanese imperial gardens for centuries, with many varieties developed by specialized growers and passed down through generations for their exceptional beauty.</p>
            
            <h4 id="list2-item-4">Japanese Iris</h4>
            <img class="img-thumbnail uniform-thumb" src="images/japanese-iris.jpeg" alt="Japanese iris flowers in purple and white">
            <p>Japanese iris (Iris ensata) produces some of the most elegant and distinctive flowers in the iris family. The blooms feature six flattened petals that spread horizontally rather than standing upright like other iris types. These striking flowers measure 4-6 inches across and appear in early summer in colors ranging from pure white to lavender, purple, blue-violet, and reddish-purple, often with contrasting veining, edges, or yellow signals at the petal bases. Some varieties have ruffled or frilled edges, while others show dramatic two-tone effects. The plants form clumps of tall, blade-like bright green foliage reaching 2-4 feet high. Originally found growing in wet meadows and alongside rice paddies in Japan, these irises have been cultivated there since the 17th century, with hundreds of named varieties developed through selective breeding for increasingly complex and beautiful flower forms.</p>
            
            <h4 id="list2-item-5">Nandina</h4>
            <img class="img-thumbnail uniform-thumb" src="images/japanese-nandina.jpg" alt="Nandina with red berries and colorful foliage">
            <p>Nandina domestica (Heavenly Bamboo) offers year-round foliage interest with its constantly changing color display. This evergreen shrub grows 4-8 feet tall with an airy, bamboo-like growing habit despite not being related to true bamboo. Its pinnately compound leaves emerge coppery-pink in spring before turning blue-green in summer. The real show begins in autumn as the finely textured foliage transforms into brilliant shades of red, orange, and burgundy, intensifying with cold weather and persisting through winter. The leaflets are arranged in tiers along reddish stems, creating an elegant architectural presence. In summer, the plant produces airy panicles of tiny white flowers followed by clusters of bright red berries that persist through winter, creating striking contrast against the colorful foliage. Compact cultivars like 'Fire Power' and 'Gulf Stream' offer even more intense coloration in smaller garden-friendly sizes.</p>
            
            <h4 id="list2-item-6">Japanese Camellia</h4>
            <img class="img-thumbnail uniform-thumb" src="images/japanese-camellia.jpg" alt="Pink camellia japonica flower">
            <p>Japanese camellias (Camellia japonica) bring exceptional floral beauty to gardens during the winter months when few other plants bloom. These evergreen shrubs or small trees produce large, perfectly formed flowers 3-5 inches across in shades ranging from pure white to soft pink, deep rose, and rich red. The blooms can be simple single forms with prominent golden stamens, semi-doubles with ruffled centers, formal doubles with geometrically arranged petals, or complex peony forms. Different varieties bloom from late fall through early spring, with flowers lasting several weeks and often appearing against snow in northern Japan. Even when not flowering, camellias offer garden structure with their dense, glossy dark green foliage that provides excellent contrast to other plants. The leaves are elliptical, leathery, and finely serrated, maintaining deep green color year-round and arranged in an attractive layered habit.</p>

      <h4 id="list3-item-1">Relax in an Onsen</h4>
      <img class="img-thumbnail uniform-thumb" src="images/onsen.jpg" alt="Traditional Japanese outdoor hot spring bath">
      <p>Visiting an onsen (hot spring bath) is a must-do for travelers looking to unwind in Japan’s beautiful natural settings. Found in scenic areas like Hakone, Beppu, and Kusatsu, onsens offer soothing mineral-rich waters, often with views of forests, rivers, or mountains. Many ryokan (traditional inns) offer private or family baths if you're shy about the nudity involved. Be sure to shower thoroughly before entering, and keep towels and hair out of the water. It's an unforgettable cultural experience that combines relaxation and tradition.</p>

      <h4 id="list3-item-2">Cherry Blossom Viewing</h4>
      <img class="img-thumbnail uniform-thumb" style="height: 200px; object-fit: cover;" src="images/cherry-blossom-view.jpg" alt="Cherry blossom viewing picnic in a Japanese park">
      <p>If you're visiting in spring (late March to early April), don't miss hanami—Japan's iconic cherry blossom viewing. Head to popular spots like Ueno Park in Tokyo or Maruyama Park in Kyoto to see fluffy pink blooms in full display. Bring snacks and drinks, or pick up a hanami bento box from a nearby convenience store or market. Some places even light up the trees at night for a magical atmosphere. Timing is everything, so check the blossom forecast online before your trip!</p>

      <h4 id="list3-item-3">Visit an Animal Café</h4>
      <img class="img-thumbnail uniform-thumb" src="images/animal-cafe.jpg" alt="Tourist petting a Shiba Inu at a Japanese animal cafe">
      <p>Animal cafés are a fun, only-in-Japan experience where you can enjoy drinks while interacting with cute animals. Whether it’s cats, owls, hedgehogs, rabbits, or even Shiba Inus, these cafés give tourists a relaxing break from sightseeing and a chance to connect with creatures you might not normally meet. They’re especially popular in Tokyo neighborhoods like Harajuku, Shibuya, and Akihabara. Many cafés have entry fees (usually includes a drink), time limits, and rules to ensure animal comfort. It’s a must-try for animal lovers and one of the most photogenic experiences in Japan!</p>

      <h4 id="list3-item-4">Explore a Japanese Castle</h4>
      <img class="img-thumbnail uniform-thumb" src="images/japanese-castle.jpg" alt="Scenic view of Himeji Castle in Japan">
      <p>Touring one of Japan’s beautifully preserved castles is a fantastic way for visitors to step back into the age of samurai and feudal lords. Castles like Himeji, Matsumoto, and Osaka feature towering white facades, moats, and multi-tiered keeps, with panoramic views from the top. Inside, many offer museum exhibits with samurai armor, historical displays, and original wooden interiors. These castles are often surrounded by gardens or cherry blossom trees, making them perfect for photos. Easy to access from major cities, a castle visit combines history, architecture, and great sightseeing all in one stop.</p>

      <h4 id="list3-item-5">Experience a Tea Ceremony</h4>
      <img class="img-thumbnail uniform-thumb" src="images/tea-ceremony.jpg" alt="Traditional Japanese tea ceremony">
      <p>Take a peaceful break from sightseeing with a traditional Japanese tea ceremony. Tourists can join short sessions in Kyoto, Tokyo, or cultural centers where hosts guide you through each elegant step of preparing and enjoying matcha tea. It's a beautiful way to experience Japanese aesthetics, hospitality, and Zen philosophy—plus, the sweets are delicious too!</p>

      <h4 id="list3-item-6">Explore Temples & Shrines</h4>
      <img class="img-thumbnail uniform-thumb" src="images/japanese-shrine.jpg" alt="Traditional Japanese shrine with torii gate">
      <p>No trip to Japan is complete without visiting its stunning temples and shrines. Wander through Kyoto’s Fushimi Inari Shrine with its endless red torii gates, or explore Tokyo’s serene Meiji Shrine. Don’t forget to purify your hands at the entrance and try your luck with an omikuji (fortune slip). Many of these sacred sites are free to enter and often surrounded by peaceful gardens and local food stalls, making them ideal stops for sightseeing and photography.</p>
